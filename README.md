Here's a little bit about myself

### Who am i

I go by the name `Jessa` on the interwebs, i'm a 20 year old, selftaught software developer. 

I generally work on things i think are fun, or interesting. This being often useless, or only useful for myself.
Though, sometimes i make something everyone can enjoy! 

### What do i do

I mainly make commandline tools for myself, to make my own life easier.
That, or i'm making something i find interesting. Like machine learning, some image things, or even security testers!

I'm not an expert, but i'm capable enough to make all the things i can think of (Even if it takes some time!).
